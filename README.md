### About

This is a very simple, unpretentious videogame made with LÃ–VE and Lua. 

Wiki available (only in Spanish).

### File structure

File structure is very straighforward. The filename indicates which structure or entity controls in the game.

`libs/` directory contains just a bunch of definitions and helper functions to manage sounds, colours and physics.
