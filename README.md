Shadows
=======

A game about progress and sacrifice, with squares.

Damien is a square, but not a regular square. He can jump, move and in exchange of some of his life can cast his shadow.

A shadow has some properties, generally it transforms into a solid object, but not always. Shadows can do a lot of things such as explode, make Damien bounce or sink , etc.
